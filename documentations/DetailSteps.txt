# Project Steps â€“ Healthcare Analysis

This document outlines the key steps followed during the project.  

=> 1. Data Collection :

- Used the provided healthcare dataset with 10,000 patient records.  
- Variables included demographics, medical conditions, admissions, costs, insurance, and facilities.  

=> 2. Data Preparation :

- Removed duplicates and filled missing values.  
- Standardized formats for dates, billing amounts, and patient attributes.  
- Created calculated fields such as average cost per condition and length of stay.  

=> 3. Data Validation :

- Checked consistency across patient IDs, admission/discharge dates, and billing amounts.  
- Verified that patient counts matched across different segments.  

=> 4. Data Modeling : 

- Built relationships between patient demographics, medical conditions, admissions, and financial data.  
- Applied star schema in Power BI for better performance.  

=> 5. Dashboard Development :

- **Disease Analysis Dashboard**: Focused on cost per disease, patient distribution, blood type analysis, and test results.  
- **Patient Care Dashboard**: Focused on demographics, admission patterns, insurance providers, and medication usage.  

=> 6. Analysis :

- Identified high-cost conditions (Cancer) and high-prevalence conditions (Asthma).  
- Noted significant abnormal test results (35%).  
- Analyzed admission types showing majority urgent/emergency cases.  
- Reviewed facility performance and high-frequency patients.  

=> 7. Insights & Business Implications :

- Cancer requires stronger cost control.  
- Asthma needs preventive programs due to high patient count.  
- Urgent and emergency cases demand more hospital capacity.  
- Blood type AB- shows higher obesity correlation.  

=> 8. Recommendations :

- Implement cost optimization strategies for cancer.  
- Develop specialized asthma management programs.  
- Strengthen emergency capacity planning.  
- Improve diagnostic protocols to reduce abnormal result rates.  

=> 9. Limitations :

- Dataset is static and does not track changes over time.  
- No treatment outcome or patient satisfaction metrics.  
- Predictive modeling not included.
